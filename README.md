# Cats App
---
This App is personal study purpose using the cat api.

# Application Stack.
---
SwiftUI + Combine based.
- Network layer: URLSession + Combine
- Presentation layer: SwiftUI

# Goal
---
    1. Try not to use any other popular network libraries because it has not much of network apis.
    - Use only URLSesison + Combine so I can really think why I need Alamofire or Moya.

    2. Consider UX as much as I can.
    - The awsome thing of `The Cat API` is that it provides variety of image extensions such as followings.  (.jpg, .png, and .gif)

    3. Make it `Testable`
    - Trying as much as to stick to functional.
